# Why do I do this?

I'm Aleix, and I've been in the NEM Community for awhile.

First, a little of story.

## When it all started

Around 2017, I was working in Atraura. Atraura was a Software Consulting firm that pushed a lot for innovation.

Our CEO, Albert, had a vision about how Blockchain will impact the world. Back then I didn't fully believe him, but somehow I trusted him on betting in this Technology. Today, I'm so glad I trusted his vision.

At 2017, the Blockchain ecosystem wasn't that mature (we can argue that today it still isn't)... and I got super frustrated as lead software architect in the company of __how hard was to do ANYTHING__.

When we had an idea I always had the same argument back in my mind.

> The same thing using traditional technologies as Spring, Django, RoR... would take a Week to develop. Using Blockchain might take forever. __The development cost is an issue that prevents innovation to happen.__

Today, that argument still applies. ough...

During that period of time, we discovered NEM and I felt in love in how the technology worked. It had a couple of things I identified as a way to go technology.

- It solves well the 80% of Blockchain Use cases
- It has mechanisms to improve security build in, Multisig accounts.
- It enabled adding text into the transactions
- Private / Public chains

Using those technology properties, we can heavy reduce our development costs.

Yes, we could back then compared to Ethereum, but not enough to be competitive in the market. More job needed to be done.

## How do we aimed to solve that issue back then?

With the limited knowledge we had, I got the mission to find a way to solve our development pain points. And then [NEM Framework Proposal appeared](https://forum.nem.io/t/nem-framework-community-proposal/5174) with one goal. __Reduce development cost to facilitate innovation__.

The community proposal didn't succeed. My vision just reinforced. People wasn't building on top of NEM enough to feel the pains.

We kept pushing. Change of strategy, one thing at a time. Let's focus in the first building block instead.

## [NEM Library](https://github.com/NemProject/nem-library-ts)

Damn! We didn't expect that. A lof of people starting to build on top of NEM Library. It was an incomplete solution, but we verified our hypothesis.

> Develop in top of NEM has pains, and the proper tooling helps Developers focus on the right things instead of dealing with Blockchain complexities.

NEM Foundation noticed what we were doing

## NEM2-SDK with NEM Foundation Support. Next stage :grin: 2018

We, Guillem and I, succeed that much, that we ended up being hired by NEM Foundation to work on developing the SDKs for Catapult, now known as Symbol.

Seem vision, same mission. Now with the proper developing support. New and evolved solution to the pains from developers in building on top of Symbol, with all the previous knowledge gained from developing NEM Library.

The result you can see it [here](https://github.com/nemtech/symbol-sdk-typescript-javascript#readme) :)

A well defined SDK that can be ported to different languages. :tada:

The impact we had back then was huge. I was seeing that the initial vision of NEM Framework was taking some form, but now with a lot of knowledge regarding the Symbol Technology, the Developers Pains and how the Blockchain Ecosystem was going to.

Then... Burn Out. :sad:

## Burn Out

I quit NEM Foundation. I needed a time off. Blockchain is a quite demanding environment and you cannot keep up with everything. I burned out and I needed time for myself. I knew I just not stop working with the tech, I just needed a different life velocity.

## Refalling in love with Symbol Blockchain. 2019

OK. I healed from the Burnout. Still, I wanted to use the Symbol Technology, not develop it.

I did a Full Distributed Social Network on top of Symbol in 2019 as my Bachelor's Thesis :grin:

You can see the document [here](https://upcommons.upc.edu/bitstream/handle/2117/168589/144347.pdf).

Damn! Things improved, but not enough :sad:

I identified different pain points:

- Infrastructure Management. I hadn't symbol-bootstrap back then, I had to deal with it by myself.
- Wallet support. It wasn't there... I had to write a browser extension by myself (it has been discontinued)
- SDK was powerful, but I missed an structured way to make Dapps.

## Today. 2021

Thinks improved :smile:. Today we have:

- Good infrastructure support
- A Wallet

But we still lack of tooling for fast innovation in terms of Dapps in Symbol :thinking:

That's why I want to continue pursuing my vision of __enabling fast innovation creating the proper tooling__ with the all knowledge I have today after 5 years following Blockchain Ecosystem and in specific Symbol Blockchain.

How?
